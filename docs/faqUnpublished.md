# How do I add friends?

Right now you can’t add friends, but you can add friends by username as Members to a Shareable Bucket

## Buckets

# Is every bucket name unique?

Only for each user. So two different users can create a bucket named 'Blaze for days', but one user cannot create 2 buckets with the same name.
Bucket names work the like digital file names within a folder.

# How do I ask to join a bucket?

That feature is not available yet.

## Transfers

# Can you undo a transfer after it has been completed?

No.

# When I link an account can you transfer money to someone else’s account (let’s say they paid me money and call you up and dispute that it was authorized or claim they made an error and sent the wrong amount...can you take back money I think I already received? or put a “hold” on it?

## Bank Linking

# How much detail in my linked account is visible to banqdrop?

# Is there a way to set up alerts so I know immediately if money I approved goes over the amount in the account or will it not even let me transfer it (aka can I do an overdraft or is there a stop in place to prevent it)?

Not yet.

# If I have a joint account (like a husband-wife scenario) can both people link that account to their banqdrop account separately?

No. A bank account can only be linked once.

# If I link a bank account are other accounts with that bank visible to banqdrop?

No. For example, suppose you have a checking and a savings account with Wells Fargo. If you link a bank account with Banqdrop by signing in with Wells Fargo and selecting your checking account, Banqdrop does not see your savings account information.

## Data Sharing / Privacy

## User Account

# How long after I delete an account does my info get wiped?

We don't currently have a way to delete your account. Also if we did, we are required to keep certain records in order to comply with regulations.
