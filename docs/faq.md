## Transfers

#### Can you undo a transfer after it has been completed?

No.

## Bank Linking

#### Is there a way to set up alerts so I know immediately if money I approved goes over the amount in the account or will it not even let me transfer it (aka can I do an overdraft or is there a stop in place to prevent it)?

Not yet.

#### If I have a joint account (like a husband-wife scenario) can both people link that account to their banqdrop account separately?

No. A bank account can only be linked once.

#### If I link a bank account are other accounts with that bank visible to banqdrop?

No. For example, suppose you have a checking and a savings account with Wells Fargo. If you link a bank account with Banqdrop by signing in with Wells Fargo and selecting your checking account, Banqdrop does not see your savings account information.

## Data Sharing / Privacy

#### Do you sell data to third parties?

No. See our [Privacy Policy](privacyPolicy)

#### Can you access the location of the person using the app track where I go?

No. We don't track your location ever.

#### Does Banqdrop see transactions made on my linked account (outside of banqdrop) or only see the balance?

Just the balance.
