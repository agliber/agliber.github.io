## Transfers

### Can you undo a transfer after it has been completed?

No.

## Bank Linking

### Is there a way to set up alerts so I know immediately if money I approved goes over the amount in the account or will it not even let me transfer it (aka can I do an overdraft or is there a stop in place to prevent it)?

Not yet.

### If I have a joint account (like a husband-wife scenario) can both people link that account to their banqdrop account separately?

No. A bank account can only be linked once.

### If I link a bank account are other accounts with that bank visible to Banqdrop?

No. For example, suppose you have a checking and a savings account with Wells Fargo. If you link a bank account with Banqdrop by signing in with Wells Fargo and selecting your checking account, Banqdrop does not see your savings account information.

## Data Sharing / Privacy

### Why does Banqdrop need my Social Security Number (SSN)?

It's required only for identification verification purposes and is a standard required by the financial service provider we use. This is in order to comply with laws intended to prevent financial crimes. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Know_your_customer

To be honest, we'd rather not know your social security number.
So to take extra care, your SSN is sent directly (from your device) to our financial service provider. Banqdrop does not see this information at all. It doesnâ€™t even touch our servers.

See [Our Privacy Policy](https://banqdrop.com/docs/privacyPolicy) or [Dwolla's Privacy Policy](https://www.dwolla.com/legal/privacy/) (Our financial service provider) for more info.

### Why does Banqdrop need my address?

We only use this information to verify your identity. We do not use this for any other purpose, we don't even store this info.

### Does Banqdrop sell data to third parties?

No. See our [Privacy Policy](privacyPolicy)

### Can Banqdrop access my location?

No. We don't track your location ever.

### Does Banqdrop see transactions made on my linked bank accounts?

No.
